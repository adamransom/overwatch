# Overwatch

A simple application which allows YouTube videos be watched out of the browser. Combined with a future Chrome/Firefox plugin, you'll be able to popout videos directly from YouTube.

## Features

- Runs quietly in the menu bar, waiting until you need to watch
- Currently only accepts YouTube embed URLs e.g. in the form https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fb6xOVdkaLM
- Handles multiple videos at once and remembers the layout

## TODO

- Add parsing of many types of YouTube URLs
- Resizing videos doesn't work yet
- Only show "Close" button when hovering over videos
- Add "Always On Top" option
- Allow videos to be made transparent (optionally becoming more opaque when hovering over)
- Much more, but it's late now and this is enough to be getting on with...
