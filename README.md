# Overwatch

A simple application which allows YouTube videos be watched out of the browser. Combined with the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/overwatch/gbjbjllnbjcefoocealghpcjjjbdpbif), you're able to popout videos directly from YouTube.

## Features (v0.1)

- Runs quietly in the menu bar, waiting until you need to watch
- Currently works with YouTube videos, with more services coming
- Opens videos using the Chrome extension or from URLs on the clipboard
- Handles multiple videos at once and remembers the layout
- Video opacity can be set (optionally becoming opaque on hover)
- Hold `Option` whilst hovering the video allows clicking on things directly below the video

## Coming soon...

- [ ] More video services
- [ ] Support for YouTube playlist URLs
- [ ] Full-screen support
- [ ] Support for `time` parameter
