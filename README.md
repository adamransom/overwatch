# Overwatch

A simple application which allows YouTube videos be watched out of the browser. Combined with a future Chrome/Firefox plugin, you'll be able to popout videos directly from YouTube.

## Features

- Runs quietly in the menu bar, waiting until you need to watch
- Accepts all forms of YouTube URLs
- Can open URL directly from the clipboard
- Handles multiple videos at once and remembers the layout

## TODO

- [x] ~~Add parsing of many types of YouTube URLs~~
- [ ] Resizing videos doesn't work yet
- [ ] Only show "Close" button when hovering over videos
- [ ] Add "Always On Top" option
- [ ] Allow videos to be made transparent (optionally becoming more opaque when hovering over)
- [ ] Much more, but it's late now and this is enough to be getting on with...
